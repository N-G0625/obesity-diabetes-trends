# Obesity and Diabetes Trends in the United States (2000–2023)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes long-term trends in obesity and diabetes prevalence in the United States from 2000 to 2023. Using a simplified, publicly available dataset, the analysis visualizes national trends and compares the growth of obesity and diabetes over time. All figures are generated programmatically using Python to ensure reproducibility.

## Data Source
The data used in this project consists of summarized national prevalence estimates for obesity and diabetes. The values are based on publicly available information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and are used for educational and illustrative purposes.

## Methods
The analysis was conducted using the Python programming language. The pandas library was used to organize and manage the dataset, while matplotlib was used to create all visualizations. Descriptive statistics, including average prevalence rates, were calculated to support comparisons between obesity and diabetes trends. The analysis is descriptive in nature and does not include statistical hypothesis testing.

## Figures
The notebook generates the following figures:
1. **National Obesity and Diabetes Trends (2000–2023):** A line chart showing changes in obesity and diabetes prevalence over time.
2. **Average Obesity vs. Diabetes Prevalence:** A bar chart comparing average prevalence rates across the study period.
3. **Difference Between Obesity and Diabetes Rates:** A line chart illustrating the yearly difference between obesity and diabetes prevalence.

Each figure is accompanied by a written explanation describing the observed trends and their public health relevance.

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Deliverable-4_Final-Code-Notebook.ipynb`.
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
3. All figures will be generated automatically.

The notebook is compatible with Google Colab and local Jupyter Notebook environments.
